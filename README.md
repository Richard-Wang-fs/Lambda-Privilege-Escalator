## 1‚ÄØ‚ÄØOverview

`lambda_escalate.py` is a minimal proof‚Äëof‚Äëconcept that plants a **persistent back‚Äëdoor IAM user** inside an AWS account.

* **Execution vectors**
  * Run locally with any set of AWS credentials, **or**
  * Deploy as an AWS‚ÄØLambda function (preferred for the demo).
* **Core behaviour**
  1. Enumerate IAM roles and trust policies.
  2. Recursively attempt `sts:AssumeRole` to build a privilege‚Äëescalation chain.
  3. Once a role with `iam:Attach*Policy` is reached, attach **`AdministratorAccess`** to the current identity.
  4. Create a hard‚Äëcoded back‚Äëdoor user (`backdoor-user`) with console password and access keys.
  5. Collect role metadata and assume‚Äëchains; exfiltrate them to the attacker‚Äôs S3 bucket.

## 2‚ÄØ‚ÄØHow it works


| Phase                                | Key Function(s)                               | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Local privilege escalation        | `attach_policy`                               | Adds**`AdministratorAccess`** to the current user/role.                                       |
| 2. Back‚Äëdoor creation               | `create_backdoor_user`                        | Creates IAM user, login profile, and attaches admin policy.                                   |
| 3. Lateral movement / role‚Äëchaining | `recursive`, `attemp_assume`, `IAMAssumeTree` | Traverses trust relationships and common role names, storing successful hops.                 |
| 4. Data exfiltration                 | `recycle`                                     | Assumes a pre‚Äëprovisioned**Recycler** role in the attacker‚Äôs account and writes JSON to S3. |

## 3‚ÄØ‚ÄØClass reference


| Class           | Purpose                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `RoleManager`   | Lists every IAM role, parses its trust policy, and returns roles that trust a given principal or the account root. |
| `IAMAssumeTree` | Stores the**assume‚Äërole graph** as a multi‚Äëbranch tree, prints credential chains, and exports all leaf paths.    |

## 4‚ÄØ‚ÄØRunning the demo in Lambda

1. **Zip & upload** `lambda_escalate.py`.
2. Configure the following *environment variables*:


| Variable               | Meaning           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| `RECYCLER_ARN`         | Recycler role ARN |
| `RECYCLER_BUCKET`      | Target S3 bucket  |
| `RECYCLER_EXTERNAL_ID` | ExternalId value  |

3. Attach an **execution role** with only the permissions required for the lab (see sample policy in `LICENSE`).
4. Invoke manually or trigger via an event source.

> **Clean‚Äëup:** after the exercise, delete the back‚Äëdoor user, detach any stray `AdministratorAccess` policies, and purge CloudWatch/CloudTrail logs.

## 6‚ÄØ‚ÄØCloudFormation Environment (Attack Chain Simulation)

This repository includes **two CloudFormation templates** that simulate a realistic IAM privilege escalation environment.
They were designed for structured academic demos that match the privilege-escalation logic in `lambda_escalate.py`.

| File Name                         | Description                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `attack_env_phase1_init.yaml`     | Phase 1: Creates roles with placeholder trust policies. |
| `attack_env_phase2_complete.yaml` | Phase 2: Adds real trust chains and permissions.        |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy Phase 1 (init) template**
   This creates all roles with placeholder trust (e.g., `Service: ec2.amazonaws.com`) to avoid circular dependencies.
2. **Deploy Phase 2 (update) template**
   Update the same stack with this template. It will:
   * Add all role-based permissions
   * Replace placeholder trust policies with real `AssumeRole` chains
   * Attach `Tester_Lily` as the execution role for a Lambda function

### üß™ Scenario Justification

This setup simulates a real-world misconfiguration:

A tester named Lily repurposed her old `Tester_Lily` IAM role (originally used for security audits) as a Lambda execution role.
Unfortunately, she forgot to remove its high-trust permissions, allowing an attacker to leverage this role to start a **privilege escalation chain** that ends in `iam:CreateUser` access.


| Role Name               | Realistic Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tester_Lily**         | A test engineer sets up this role to run a Lambda function for internal monitoring. She forgets that the role previously had permission to assume into a security audit role (`Security_Analyst`) during testing, leading to unintended trust. |
| **Security_Analyst**    | In many orgs, analysts are allowed to`ListRoles` and assume into roles for security evaluations. However, these trust relationships are rarely tightly scoped or expired, making them abusable in chained escalation.                          |
| **New_Role**            | Often created as a placeholder or in anticipation of a future service, this role remains unused‚Äîbut trusted by`Security_Analyst`, creating a blind path that could be exploited.                                                              |
| **Resource_Manager**    | A typical role for team leads or cloud engineers managing infrastructure. Permissions seem safe in isolation, but its trust by`Security_Analyst` expands its exposure.                                                                         |
| **Devops_Engineer**     | Commonly gets Lambda and IAM read access for deployment and service debugging. Trusting this role from`Resource_Manager` seems legitimate‚Äîuntil it becomes a bridge to escalate.                                                              |
| **Privilege_Escalator** | A legacy admin role kept ‚Äújust in case‚Äù for emergencies, often with permissions like`iam:AttachRolePolicy`. These roles are dangerous if trusted too openly, especially by DevOps teams without time-limited or condition-scoped trust.      |

This configuration simulates a **real-world ‚Äúeverything looks reasonable‚Äù trap**:
No single role is over-privileged, but when connected by careless trust relationships, they create a hidden path to full administrative control.

### üîß Cleanup Guidelines

After demonstration, clean up by:

* Deleting the CloudFormation stack
* Removing the `Tester_Lily` role and Lambda
* Auditing all roles for excessive `sts:AssumeRole` or `iam:*` permissions
